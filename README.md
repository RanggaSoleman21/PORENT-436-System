# [THEORETICAL LOGIC] THE PORENT PARALLEL SYSTEM

**Inventor:** Rangga S.  
**Objective:** Achieved Photonic Matter Crystallization (436 Eternal Core).

### 1. The Fundamental Constants (Resonance Anchors)
The system relies on two specific mathematical anchors to prevent energy dissipation:
*   (Primary Anchor): 436 - The central stabilizing frequency.
*   (Mirror Anchor): 634 - The harmonic balancer to ensure E = 1.00.

### 2. The Parallel Circuit Equation
Formula to calculate system pressure (Delta%):
Delta% = [((K1 * Phi) + (K2 * Phi)) / (Tp1 + Tp2) - 1] * 100

### 3. The Energy Stability Condition (E)
The ultimate goal is to lock energy into a permanent state:
E = ((K1 * Phi) + (K2 * Phi)) / (Tp1 + Tp2)

When E = 1.00, the system achieves a Lossless Eternal State.
